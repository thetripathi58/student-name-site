# Chidanand's Portfolio

hey! Welcome to my portfolio. 
It's coming up tomorrow when I learn HTML & CSS.

All my life I have been observant on how to make the world around me simpler or more productive.
Software engineering gave me the vehicle to leverage my skills and contribute on a global scale. Transforming a hobby into a career has been an incredible and rewarding experience.

For now, I know:
1. JavaScript
2. NodeJS
3. Repl.it
4. CHALK
